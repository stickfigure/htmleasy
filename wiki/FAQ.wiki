#summary Frequently Asked Questions

*When should I use Htmleasy over XYZ framework?*

Most of the popular Java web frameworks such as Wicket, Tapestry, JSF have a long pedigree and have grown up in a Web 1.0 world. They work hard to abstract away aspects of the HTTP request/response model and manage all manner of state automatically.  Htmleasy is a step closer to the HTTP world.  The focus is on REST - HTML verbs, clean URLs and AJAX/JSON. Htmleasy is very light on the server-side and this makes it ideal for Web 2.0 projects where more of the heavy lifting will be done via AJAX on the client-side.  

Htmleasy is a perfect server-side framework for projects leveraging the growing number of client-side Javascript options such as JQuery and itâ€™s plugin ecosystem, Backbone.js, Sproutcore, etc. REST is natural, HTML is native, and it doesn't carry much server-side baggage.

*It seems to be missing the basics. How do I say add a paginated table of results, or validate a form with field-level feedback?*

That's correct. Isn't it great! You're now free to do it in the way you feel is most appropriate. AJAX scrolling, JQuery form validation, etc.

*What is the different between Htmleasy and Spring MVC?*

Both are push MVC environments. Htmleasy uses standard JAX-RS annotations to define paths and map methods to requests. This allows you to leverage the same REST API across all areas of your applications whether it be JSON REST or plain HTML requests.  Spring of course provides a lot more services out of the box.

*What features are planned for the future?*

Not a lot because the goal of Htmleasy is to remain very simple an elegant.  If you have any ideas that fit within this ethos, please make them know on the discussion forum.  A few being considered at the moment include.

 * Maven/Ivy POM.
 * Maybe views could be resolver automatically based on path annotations (i.e. convention over configuration).

*If I use Htmleasy are I putting all my eggs in one basket?*
